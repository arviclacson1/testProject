Introduction
The video discusses the role of Management Information Systems (MIS) in business intelligence and analytics, including data visualization, data mining, predictive analysis, and reporting. The video explains the purpose of Management Information Systems (MIS) in the business industry and the tools used to edit the video. Essentially, Management Information Systems (MIS) assist business companies in producing reports to influence their direction positively. Its purpose is to set performance goals. The system ensures that the proper data is collected from all the different sources, processed, filtered, and sent to all necessary areas. The framework is expected to satisfy the data needs of an individual, a gathering of people, and the administration functionaries: the upper management and managers. This report provides an overview of how Management Information System (MIS) is implemented, explains the video-making process, the analysis of the video-making process and the results, and the conclusion.

Methodology
The video was made to explain the primary purpose of Management Information Systems (MIS) in specifically the business industry. The non-experimental research method that was utilized to gather the information was by collecting data from credible sources such as established online academic journals, books, and articles. The collected information was then filtered and incorporated into the script for the video-making. Lastly, an online video editor, InVideo, was utilized as a tool to support the video editing process.

Data Collection and Analysis
One of the topics discussed in the video is the utilization of Management Information Systems (MIS) in data collection and analysis. Integration of MIS in data collection and analysis allows for an efficient way to collect, store, and analyze data into useful information which can be used for decision-making in business (Laudon & Laudon, 2016). Examples of data that can be collected include number of units sold, inventory levels, price, time and details of transactions, customer feedback, brand reputation, and other metrics. The data collected, with the help of MIS, can be interpreted into meaningful information which can be used to generate insights about performance, efficiency, and areas of improvement of a business. Data cleansing and transformation are also a part of improving the accuracy and consistency of data.

	Multiple tools enable businesses to incorporate MIS with data collection and analysis. One of the tools used is the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. It provides various programs which can be used to collect and analyze data in different functional areas such as human resources, supply chain, and finance. Another popular tool is the customer relationship planning (CRM) system which allows businesses to analyze their consumer data and find ways to improve their sales, customer relations, and marketing activities (Marakas & O’Brien, 2017). 
Decision-Making Process
	Every decision leads to an output which may or may not prompt an action. The video will then go over on MIS provides managers with timely and accurate information, allowing businesses to make informed decisions. After data collection, multiple analyzing techniques such as data mining, machine learning, and predictive modelling enable companies to anticipate market behavior, make forecasts, and optimize pricing. Furthermore, MIS helps businesses align their strategies in the ever-changing market environment (Laudon & Laudon, 2016). Informed decisions and insights from MIS allow firms to be flexible, have more capability in problem-solving, and increase creativity. Usually, informed choices, in a business context, are typically followed by actions like cost-benefit analysis to maximize benefits while minimizing costs (Berisha-Shaqiri, 2014). 
MIS in Business Intelligence
	The last topic in the video is business intelligence powered by MIS and its benefits. As mentioned in the previous subsections, MIS is a powerful tool to collect and analyze data into useful information. Incorporating MIS in business intelligence yields the following benefits:
1.	Allows managers to make informed decisions based on relevant information. MIS provides the information in an accurate and timely manner (Laudon & Laudon, 2016).
2.	MIS Tools allows for efficient data reporting and visualization, making it easier for shareholders to understand and act if needed (Laudon & Laudon, 2016).
3.	MIS allows for better data consolidation and integration as it uses data from internal and external sources and general information from the internet. This enables organizations to understand their operations better and get important insights (Turban, Sharda, & Delen, 2019).
 

Analysis
Strengths and Limitations
The video content provides a concise and clear explanation of the role of Management Information System (MIS) by introducing the main aspects and relevant real-life examples in business industries. In the video, visual transitions are incorporated to enhance engagement and understanding. For instance, the benefits of business intelligence, data analysis, data collection, visualization and various aspects of MIS are covered. Pictures are used to depict data analysis and decision-making processes, allowing a clearer visualization for viewers. Thus, the content provides a great understanding of the role of MIS in decision-making.
On the other hand, the video does not provide the potential challenges or limitations of implementing MIS in organizations which can provide a balanced perspective. In addition, there were several complications during the video-editing process using InVideo. For instance, the templates formats are limited, and the animations are jittery. Lastly, most of the images available on InVideo are unrelated to the text. Thus, several images had to be replaced manually to match their relevancy to the text.
Opportunities for Improvement
While the video covers the main aspects of Management Information Systems (MIS), several recommendations can be made to improve the video. Firstly, while the video provides brief examples of MIS in day-to-day situations, the applicability of the content can be enhanced by using more detailed case scenarios or success stories where MIS has been successfully implemented in the real world. Moreover, the role of MIS can vary based on the context so it would be beneficial to provide insights or examples specific to different industries or sectors rather than giving general examples.
Key Insights
Management Information Systems (MIS) provide valuable insights and streamline operations which enables better market understanding to enhance the operational efficiency of the industries. MIS provides organizations with advanced techniques to make data forecasts, optimize pricing and personalize offerings which opens various opportunities for businesses by contributing to long-term success. This highly contributes to keeping a competitive business in the market.

Conclusion
Overall, the executives of Data Frameworks of Management Information Systems (MIS) play a crucial role in the business by utilizing dynamic cycles, data collection, and analysis. The video effectively conveys the primary objective of MIS and provided examples from real-world situations to demonstrate its significance. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are examples of MIS tools that allow businesses to efficiently collect and analyze data from a variety of sources.
